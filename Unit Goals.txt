A big part of this unit is learning the basics of what "Machine Learning" is and get some experience playing with a machine learning model.

I may need to break this into multiple units. There is a lot to cover to get a solid foundation?

- Why is this called Machine Learning? - Do I need a history unit? Probably not. 

- Understanding Linear Regression
	- This is the part where we take a deeper dive of "exploring". You wont be tested on the understanding and derivation but it is important to understand the language of "math" to see where the deriviation comes from and how we can leverage linear algebra to make things easier to write. 
- What are the levels we can pull and push? 
	- Possible hyperparamterization? (This is important for later more complex machine learning models)
	- How do they automate this? How can I grade this? 
	- Also how do I grade plots, this might need to be a bit more manual. 
- How can they understand if their results are good??? What does it mean for results to be good?



This unit is going to be the backbone of the entire course. If they do not get a solid grasp on this concept then it will be more difficult for them. It may also be good to walk through a paper with them as well. Maybe the original one for linear regression?
- This does not need to be a traditional course
- can I throw in some tidbit of history?
- Can I do something crazy and risk it for the buiscuit? 

I want to have hw every week.
